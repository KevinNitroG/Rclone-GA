# NOTICE: ‚ö†Ô∏è

## COMMAND:

- Because there is something suck which make the end of the command has a character `‚êç`, or it will show `\r` in the log of github workflow. So, I suggest if you use copy, sync, move,... command, you should put the `destination` at the end of the command, which will make the file / folder's name have `‚êç`. You can delete it later üò™

- If you don't follow this, it will highly get error!
